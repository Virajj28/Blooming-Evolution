Try and get more control of props, hooks, and data flows across components..
1) Sending data from parent to child component
2) Sending data from 1st child to parent component and then passing it to the 2nd child  (1st and 2nd child are basically sibling components)
3) Working with hooks. building custom hooks
4) Get more hang of Types.. always definging input params of the function and responses with proper types instead of marking them as any
